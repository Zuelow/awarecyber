# Understanding Zero Trust Security

Zero trust security is a strategic approach to cybersecurity that eliminates implicit trust and continuously validates every stage of digital interaction. Unlike traditional security models that follow a "trust but verify" approach, zero trust follows a "never trust, always verify" principle.

## Key Principles of Zero Trust

1. Verify explicitly
2. Use least privilege access
3. Assume breach

## Implementation Steps

1. Identify your protect surface
2. Map the transaction flows
3. Architect your zero trust network
4. Create your zero trust policy
5. Monitor and maintain

## Benefits

- Improved security posture
- Better visibility into network traffic
- Reduced attack surface
- Enhanced compliance capabilities

Remember: Zero trust is not a single technology but a holistic approach to network security that incorporates various principles and technologies.
